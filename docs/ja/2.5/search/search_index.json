With Appium 2.x, the Appium server and the Appium drivers are versioned and released separately. This means that drivers can be on their own release cadence and that you can get driver updates as they happen, rather than waiting for a new Appium server release. The way to check for driver updates is with the CLI:</p> <pre><code>appium driver list --updates\n</code></pre> <p>If any updates are available, you can then run the <code>update</code> command for any given driver:</p> <pre><code>appium driver update xcuitest\n</code></pre> <p>(For a complete description of the update command, check out the Extension CLI doc)</p> <p>To update the Appium server itself, you do the same thing as in the past: <code>npm i -g appium</code>.

Before the W3C WebDriver Protocol was designed as a web standard, several other protocols were used for both Selenium and Appium. These protocols were the \"JSONWP\" (JSON Wire Protocol) and \"MJSONWP\" (Mobile JSON Wire Protocol). The W3C Protocol differs from the (M)JSONWP protocols in a few small ways.</p> <p>Up until Appium 2.0, Appium supported both protocols, so that older Selenium/Appium clients could still communicate with newer Appium servers. Moving forward, support for older protocols will be removed.</p>"},{"location":"guides/migrating-1-to-2/#capabilities","title":"Capabilities","text":"<p>One significant difference between old and new protocols is in the format of capabilities. Previously called \"desired capabilities\", and now called simply \"capabilities\", there is now a requirement for a so-called \"vendor prefix\" on any non-standard capabilities. The list of standard capabilities is given in the WebDriver Protocol spec, and includes a few commonly used capabilities such as <code>browserName</code> and <code>platformName</code>.</p> <p>These standard capabilities continue to be used as-is. All other capabilities must include a \"vendor prefix\" in their name. A vendor prefix is a string followed by a colon, such as <code>appium:</code>. Most of Appium's capabilities go beyond the standard W3C capabilities and must therefore include vendor prefixes (we recommend that you use <code>appium:</code> unless directed otherwise by documentation). For example:</p> <ul> <li><code>appium:app</code></li> <li><code>appium:noReset</code></li> <li><code>appium:deviceName</code></li> </ul> <p>This requirement may or may not be a breaking change for your test suites when targeting Appium 2.0. If you're using an updated Appium client (at least one maintained by the Appium team), the client will add the <code>appium:</code> prefix for you on all necessary capabilities automatically. New versions of Appium Inspector will also do this. Cloud-based Appium providers may also do this. So simply be aware that if you get any messages to the effect that your capabilities lack a vendor prefix, this is how you solve that problem.</p> <p>On a related note, it will no longer be possible to start Appium sessions using WebDriver clients that don't support the W3C protocol (see below for a comment to this effect for the WD library).</p> <p>To make everyone's lives a bit easier, we've also introduced the option of wrapping up all Appium-related capabilities into one object capability, <code>appium:options</code>. You can bundle together anything that you would normally put an <code>appium:</code> prefix on into this one capability.

The goal of the Selenium project has been to support UI automation of web browsers, and in this way we can think of it as occupying a subset of Appium's goals. Along the way, Selenium (and, after they merged, another project called WebDriver) developed a relatively stable API for browser automation.</p> <p>Over the years, Selenium worked with various web browser vendors and the W3C standards group to turn its API into an official web browser standard, called the WebDriver specification. All the main browsers now implement automation capabilities inline with the WebDriver spec, without the Selenium team having to maintain any software that performs actual automation; standards for the win!</p> <p>Appium's initial goals were to develop an automation standard for mobile apps (iOS and Android). We could have made up something new, but in the spirit of joining forces and keeping standards, well, standard, we decided to adopt the WebDriver spec as Appium's API.<sup>2</sup> While user interaction on websites and in mobile native apps are not entirely identical (with even greater differences once we start to consider, for example, TV platforms controlled by simple remotes), the fact is that most software UIs are pretty much the same. This means that the WebDriver spec provides automation API primitives (finding elements, interacting with elements, loading pages or screens, etc...) that more or less map to any platform.</p> <p>Of course, Appium wants to support the cases where user interaction does differ from web to mobile or web to TV, and so Appium also makes use of the built-in extensibility of the WebDriver spec. The result is that, no matter what platform you want to automate, when you use Appium, you will do so using the standard WebDriver spec, with two caveats:</p> <ul> <li>We might not have any way to support a particular WebDriver API command on a given platform, and   so some commands might be unsupported (for example, getting or setting cookies is not possible in   the world of native mobile app automation).</li> <li>We might support automation behaviours that go beyond what's available in the WebDriver API   command list, though any such commands will be valid and spec-compliant extensions to the   WebDriver API.</li> </ul> <p>How do you actually use the WebDriver API, particularly in the context of Appium? We'll cover that in the section below on how Appium provides universal programming language access. All you need to know for now is that the way Appium introduces a universal UI automation interface is by implementing the WebDriver protocol.</p>"},{"location":"intro/#platform-automation-behaviour","title":"Platform automation behaviour","text":"<p>The next question is, how does Appium map this protocol to automation behaviour on a wide range of platforms? The trick is that, strictly speaking, Appium doesn't! It leaves this responsibility up to a kind of software module called an Appium driver. There's a whole Driver Introduction which you can read next, so we won't go into huge detail on how they work for now.</p> <p>What's important to understand at the moment is that a driver is kind of like a pluggable module for Appium that gives Appium the power to automate a particular platform (or set of platforms, depending on the goal of the driver). At the end of the day, a driver's responsibility is to simply implement an Appium-internal interface representing the WebDriver protocol. How it implements this interface is totally up to the driver, based on its strategy for making automation happen on a specific platform. Typically, and with a lot more complexity and difficulty in the details, a driver does this by relying on platform-specific automation technologies. For example, Apple maintains an iOS automation technology called XCUITest. The Appium driver that supports iOS app automation is called the XCUITest Driver because ultimately what it does is convert the WebDriver protocol to XCUITest library calls.</p> <p>One of the reasons that drivers are independent, pluggable modules is that they work completely differently from one another. The tools and requirements for building and using drivers for different platforms are completely different. And so Appium lets you use just the drivers that you need for your automation tasks. Choosing drivers and installing them so that you can use them with your Appium instance is so important that Appium has its very own CLI for managing drivers.</p> <p>So, to answer our original question, the way that Appium provides access to automation capabilities for a given platform is that the Appium team (or anyone else<sup>3</sup>) writes a driver for that platform, implementing as much or little of the WebDriver protocol as desired. The driver can then be installed by anyone using Appium.</p>"},{"location":"intro/#universal-programming-language-access","title":"Universal programming language access","text":"<p>But what does it mean, or look like, to use Appium, anyway? Since Appium is ultimately a Node.js program, it could have looked like importing Appium and its drivers as libraries into your own Node.js programs. But that wouldn't meet Appium's goal of providing automation capabilities to people using any popular programming language.</p> <p>Luckily, the fact that Appium rode in on Selenium's coattails meant that we had a solution to this problem from day one. You see, the WebDriver specification is actually an HTTP-based protocol, meaning it is designed to be used over a network rather than within the memory of a single program.</p> <p>One of the main benefits of this \"client-server\" architecture is that it allows the automation implementer (the thing doing the automation, in this case the 'server') to be completely distinct from the automation runner (the thing defining what automation should be done, in what steps, etc..., in this case the 'client'). Basically, all the \"hard stuff\" (actually figuring out how to make automation happen on a given platform) can be handled in one place by the server, and \"thin\" client libraries can be written in any programming language which simply encode HTTP requests to the server in language-appropriate way. It's possible, in other words, to bring basic Appium / WebDriver capabilities to a new programming language relatively easily, assuming high-level HTTP libraries exist, simply by coding up a basic HTTP client in that language.</p> <p>There are a couple important takeaways here for you, the Appium user:</p> <ul> <li>Appium is an HTTP server. It must run as a process on some computer for as long as you want to   be able to use it for automation. It must be accessible on the network to whichever computer you   want to use to run the automation from (whether that is the same machine or one across the   world).</li> <li>Unless you want to write raw HTTP calls or use cURL, using Appium for automation involves the use   of an Appium Client in the language of your choice. The goal of each of these   clients is to encapsulate the WebDriver protocol so that rather than worrying about the protocol   itself, you can work with objects and methods that feel idiomatic for your language.</li> <li>The Appium server and the Appium client do not need to be running on the same computer. You   simply need to be able to send HTTP requests from the client to the server over some network.   This greatly facilitates the use of cloud providers for Appium, since they can host the Appium   server and any related drivers and devices, and all you need to do is point your client script to   their secure endpoints.</li> </ul> <p>And of course, none of this is about \"testing\" per se, purely about the use of Appium and its client libraries for automation purposes. If you want to do automation for the purpose of \"testing\", you'll likely want to enlist the help of test runners, test frameworks, and the like, none of which need be related to Appium; one of the benefits of Appium's \"universal accessibility\" is that it plays well with whatever set of tools you find most beneficial for your situation.</p>"},{"location":"intro/#appiums-huge-scope","title":"Appium's huge scope","text":"<p>Appium's vision (automation of everything under a single API) is huge! Certainly, much bigger than the team of core maintainers for the open source project. So how does Appium hope to achieve this goal? Basically, by empowering the community to develop functionality on top of Appium as a platform. This is what we call the Appium \"ecosystem\".</p> <p>The Appium team does officially maintain a few drivers itself (for example, the XCUITest driver that we spoke about earlier). But it cannot hope to have the platform-specific expertise or the capacity to maintain drivers for many different platforms. But what we have done, particularly beginning with Appium 2.0, is to provide tools to empower the community to join in our vision:</p> <ul> <li>Anyone can create a driver simply by creating a Node.js module that conforms to the appropriate   conventions and implements any (sub|super)set of the WebDriver protocol. Creating a driver often   involves a minimal amount of code because the WebDriver protocol details are abstracted away, and   many helper libraries are available---the same libraries that power the Appium team's own   drivers.</li> <li>Sharing drivers with others is easy using the Appium driver CLI. There is no central authority.   Anyone can share drivers publicly or privately, for free or for sale. Drivers can be open or   closed source (though obviously we appreciate open source!).</li> </ul> <p>Appium's vision of being a platform for development extends beyond the support of automation for all app platforms. As a popular automation tool, there are many opportunities for integrating Appium with all kinds of other tools and services. In addition, there are many feature ideas for Appium, either as a core server or in its incarnation across various drivers, which the core team will never have time to build. And so, with Appium 2.0, Appium has released a plugin system that enables anyone to build and share modules that change how Appium works!</p> <p>In the same way that drivers are easily shareable and consumable via the Appium driver CLI, plugins can be published and consumed via a parallel Plugin CLI. Plugins can do all sorts of things, for example adding the ability for Appium to find and interact with screen regions based on a template image (as in the <code>images</code> plugin). There are very few limitations on what you can do with plugins, so you might also be interested in learning how to Build Plugins in Node.js that can be used with Appium.</p> <p>So that's Appium: an extensible, universal interface for the UI automation of potentially everything!
